## Do this now

This directory contains the Nugem program in $nugem. This is a cli that users
interact with using a command line.

The nugem program is being rewritten. A lot of progress has been made, but work
remains. `README.md` is an accurate description of the desired end result.

This project creates the `nugem` command in `/home/mslinn/.rbenv/shims/nugem` when`rake install` is executed.

Your job is to work with me step by step to complete the rewrite.

The previous version is provided in this same Git repo, with the last release at
[tag 0.7.4](https://github.com/igorj/creategem/tree/v0.7.4). We will refer to
that source code to complete the work because an older version of most of the
code that we need can be found there.

We are currently working on the `nugem jekyll` subcommand option processing.


-f works but --force is not recognized.
