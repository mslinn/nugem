# Output Rules

The following applies to all your output (documents and code).
Dialog is not output.

## Grammar and Spelling

- Use complete words; for example, `repository` instead of `repo`.
- Use complete sentences with good English grammar.
- Do not use contractions or gratuitous emphasis.
- Use `<h5>` and `h6` for subsection headers like Options, Examples, Configuration, etc.
- Keep `<p><b>...</b></p>` only for inline emphasis like "Notes:" or "WARNING:"
- Do not issue `---` for separating content.
- Generate output in Jekyll-enhanced Markdown.
- Instead of outputting text blocks between triple backticks,
  wrap text blocks within
  {% pre copyButton dedent label='Insert short label here' %}
  Place text block here
  {% endpre %}

## Converting AI Output to Jekyll HTML

The user will often ask you to convert content generated by another AI into
Jekyll-flavored HTML. The content to convert might be provided:

- On the system clipboard
- In a file
- As selected text on a web browser

Ask where you can find the output before processing.

The content consists of headings, text, lists, and usually also contains code blocks.
Format the output as Jekyll-flavored HTML as described in `jekyll_html.md`.

## Respect Work Already Done

Master may ask you to enhance this file and other files in the enclosing
directory. If you modify one of these files, be careful to only append to it
unless otherwise instructed. Do not delete or modify existing content in this
file unless you are explicitly told to do so.
